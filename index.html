Your mortgage advisor can talk you through all of the details and help you decide which type is best for your personal situation, but here is a brief overview of the most important differences:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFixed-rate mortgages\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe most common type of mortgage in Switzerland is the fixed-rate mortgage. With this type of mortgage, you \u0026ldquo;fix\u0026rdquo; your interest rate for a predetermined period of time, usually between 10 and 20 years.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis means that your regular payments will remain the same for the duration of your fixed term, regardless of market conditions, allowing for long-term financial planning. If interest rates go up, your monthly repayments will remain the same - however, you equally won\u0026rsquo;t benefit if interest rates fall.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAt the end of your fixed rate term, you will either switch to a variable rate mortgage or renegotiate a new fixed-rate mortgage.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eVariable-rate mortgages in Switzerland\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eA variable rate mortgage, as the name suggests, follows market conditions. Instead of having a fixed mortgage interest rate, your interest rate will rise and fall in line with official interest rates. This means that your monthly repayments may go up or down during the life of your mortgage. If mortgage interest rates fall, you will feel the benefit of this more quickly than if you had a fixed-rate mortgage, but equally if interest rates rose, so would your repayments.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOne benefit of variable-rate mortgages is that your initial interest rate is usually lower than it would be for a fixed-rate mortgage. However, that is liable to change over the term of your mortgage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMany policies have no minimum repayment, meaning contracts can last up to 50 years. This may be more manageable as a monthly payment, but it also means that it could take a long time for you to pay off your mortgage.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eInterbank offered rate mortgage (LIBOR and SARON)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eInterbank rates or average-rate overnight mortgages are variable rate mortgages that only change in cost after a specific period of time. Instead of changing each month like a traditional variable rate mortgage, LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) or SARON (Swiss Average Rate Overnight) mortgages see their costs changed every three, six or 12 months.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis means you are less vulnerable to dramatic increases in interest rates and yet still benefit from a more flexible policy. Since 2021, LIBOR rates have started to be phased out in favour of SARON rates, meaning that interest rates will adhere to the Swiss market instead of a global London-based metric. A SARON mortgage is typically short-term, with banks usually offering them for four to 10 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBridging loans in Switzerland\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBridging loans are designed to cover the cost of buying a new house while your old house is being sold.

These loans are only available if you are using your old house as capital to buy a new home and will only cover around 60 to 80 percent of the house\u0026rsquo;s value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBear in mind that these loans are only supposed to be short-term solutions.

Finally, this amount is then capped at somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of the rental value (depending on the canton) to calculate the imputed rental value.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, if you own your home with a mortgage, you can also deduct any interest you pay on your mortgage from your taxable income, as well as some maintenance costs and value-maintaining renovations or conversions.

Canton Schwyz has no property transfer tax or registration fee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDifferent cantons have different rules on who pays the property transfer tax.

This profit is then taxed based on how long you have been resident in the property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOwners that have lived in their homes for long periods of time usually pay significantly less tax when they sell compared to those who resell their homes just a few years after purchasing them.

Although the purpose of this question is usually to ease the candidate in, don\u0026rsquo;t miss the opportunity to spin it into a way to talk about what makes you a good fit for the role. This is your classic \u0026ldquo;elevator pitch\u0026rdquo; introduction. The focus should be on what makes you an ideal candidate for the job, perhaps with some information about your interests thrown in. It\u0026rsquo;s key to keep it relatively short, no more than two to three minutes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eCan you tell us about some of your achievements?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis gives you the opportunity to show off a little, without overdoing it.

Be sure to give some examples to back up your answer.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhat are your weaknesses?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s good to be honest here - but not brutally so. Keep the job description in mind as well: if you\u0026rsquo;re applying for a role as a PA, don\u0026rsquo;t tell them you\u0026rsquo;re scatty and constantly losing things. Try to put a positive spin on your answer, for instance by talking about a weakness you\u0026rsquo;ve recognised in yourself and taken steps to improve.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhere do you see yourself in five years?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eLots of interviews will feature a question like this that focuses on your long-term trajectory and ambitions. Basically, the interviewer is asking how this job fits in. They want to know if you\u0026rsquo;re going to stick around, or if you\u0026rsquo;ll upstick as soon as you find a better opportunity. Focusing on both your short- and long-term goals, explain how this role and the company fit into your career plan.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSwiss job interview questions about your work experience\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eYou can be pretty sure that your interview will also include some questions about the advertised role, your current role and any other work experience you have.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhy did you apply for this job?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis specific question requires a super-specific answer.

Explain, giving examples, why you would be suited to the role, and what you would focus on if you were hired. You could also talk about things you know about the company that appeal to you.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhy are you the best candidate for the job?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis question is asking what makes you stand out from the other candidates. Of course, you don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about the other candidates. Instead, you need to prepare a confident and concise summary of what you have to offer, and why it aligns with what the company is looking for. It\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to check the job description once again when preparing an answer to this question.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHow do you deal with stressful situations?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eNot every day at \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/career/working-in-switzerland\"\u003ework\u003c/a\u003e is always a good one. By asking you this question, the interviewer wants to know how you deal with stressful or conflict situations.

Therefore, it is important to make sure that all receipts, expenses, invoices, payments and social security payments are compiled into annual report folders. The tax authorities may request files from any year, so it is recommended to have all financial documents printed, compiled and digitised to avoid any fines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCommon questions about freelancing in Switzerland\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important to know the key aspects involved in freelancing in Switzerland in order to remain financially secure and protected.

Although the purpose of this question is usually to ease the candidate in, don\u0026rsquo;t miss the opportunity to spin it into a way to talk about what makes you a good fit for the role. This is your classic \u0026ldquo;elevator pitch\u0026rdquo; introduction. The focus should be on what makes you an ideal candidate for the job, perhaps with some information about your interests thrown in. It\u0026rsquo;s key to keep it relatively short, no more than two to three minutes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eCan you tell us about some of your achievements?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis gives you the opportunity to show off a little, without overdoing it.

Be sure to give some examples to back up your answer.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhat are your weaknesses?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s good to be honest here - but not brutally so. Keep the job description in mind as well: if you\u0026rsquo;re applying for a role as a PA, don\u0026rsquo;t tell them you\u0026rsquo;re scatty and constantly losing things. Try to put a positive spin on your answer, for instance by talking about a weakness you\u0026rsquo;ve recognised in yourself and taken steps to improve.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhere do you see yourself in five years?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eLots of interviews will feature a question like this that focuses on your long-term trajectory and ambitions. Basically, the interviewer is asking how this job fits in. They want to know if you\u0026rsquo;re going to stick around, or if you\u0026rsquo;ll upstick as soon as you find a better opportunity. Focusing on both your short- and long-term goals, explain how this role and the company fit into your career plan.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSwiss job interview questions about your work experience\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eYou can be pretty sure that your interview will also include some questions about the advertised role, your current role and any other work experience you have.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhy did you apply for this job?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis specific question requires a super-specific answer.

Explain, giving examples, why you would be suited to the role, and what you would focus on if you were hired. You could also talk about things you know about the company that appeal to you.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhy are you the best candidate for the job?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis question is asking what makes you stand out from the other candidates. Of course, you don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about the other candidates. Instead, you need to prepare a confident and concise summary of what you have to offer, and why it aligns with what the company is looking for. It\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to check the job description once again when preparing an answer to this question.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHow do you deal with stressful situations?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eNot every day at \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/career/working-in-switzerland\"\u003ework\u003c/a\u003e is always a good one. By asking you this question, the interviewer wants to know how you deal with stressful or conflict situations.

Therefore, it is important to make sure that all receipts, expenses, invoices, payments and social security payments are compiled into annual report folders. The tax authorities may request files from any year, so it is recommended to have all financial documents printed, compiled and digitised to avoid any fines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCommon questions about freelancing in Switzerland\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is important to know the key aspects involved in freelancing in Switzerland in order to remain financially secure and protected.

This bill will detail your presumed total income and estimate how much tax you should be paying. It will also show you where your contributions will be spent, such as on \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/education/primary-secondary-education/swiss-school-system\"\u003eschools\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/expat-info/swiss-emergency-numbers-services\"\u003eemergency services\u003c/a\u003e.

This process is allowed if you have a rough estimate of what you are going to pay and want to pay as soon as possible, or for those who believe that their bills may increase as more information is discovered. These payments are taken into account when calculating your tax rebate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eNext steps after paying your tax bill in Switzerland\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe process of paying your taxes in Switzerland does not end once you have submitted your payments. All levels of government are constantly reviewing financial data and adjusting the amount taxpayers pay as the year progresses. It is not uncommon for a final, definite amount of tax to be set three years after the financial year in question ends. During this time, you will receive regular updates from both authorities as to whether you are due a refund or are required to pay more in taxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTax refunds in Switzerland\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is highly likely that the estimate you receive for your first tax bill will be changed by the tax authorities. This can result in the tax bill being increased or reduced by up to 20.000 Swiss francs, once the calculations for the year are completed. This might mean that you are due a tax refund, or alternatively that you have to pay more in tax. These calculations are done every six to nine months. Overpayments of Swiss taxes are also factored into the rebate that you might receive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eInterest on tax rebates in Switzerland\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the state owes you a tax rebate, you are entitled to receive the compounded interest on the outstanding balance alongside the original sum, beginning when the first tax bill was received by the authorities. Conversely, if it is found that you owe tax, you are also liable to pay interest on the outstanding balance that you owe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow to apply for a Swiss tax refund\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery time the calculations for a tax year are revised, you will receive a letter detailing the changes made. This will include any payments you may have to pay, or any tax refund that you might receive. This is done automatically and will continue until the final figures are determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAppealing a decision made by Swiss tax authorities\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you believe that the calculations made by the Swiss tax authorities are incorrect, you can launch an appeal. Appeals are made if you believe that expenses have not been adequately deducted or that they have made a mistake when calculating your income. Appeals are a lengthy, complicated process, so we recommend that you employ the services of an accountant in order to submit an appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003ePaying taxes while on a Swiss L and B residence permit\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are new to Switzerland and have received a Swiss L or B residence permit, your taxes are modified to be simpler. Your taxes are deducted at the source by your employer (\u003cem\u003eQuellensteuer\u003c/em\u003e). This means that you do not have to submit a comprehensive tax return as detailed above. However, once you are granted a \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/expat-info/official-issues/residence-permit-switzerland\"\u003eSwiss C-residence permit\u003c/a\u003e, you will have to go through the extended system.\u003c/p\u003e"])

This is a charge on the taxable profits made in Switzerland by a company. These charges are tax-deductible, so although the flat rate of income tax federally is 8,5 percent, in reality, the total amount is around 7,8 percent of your taxable income each year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhen will Switzerland apply the OECD minimum corporate tax rate?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn January 1, 2024, Switzerland implemented the minimum corporate taxation plan proposed by the\u0026nbsp;Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This means that, along with over 140 other countries around the world, the federal government will impose a minimum tax rate on large companies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInternationally active companies or corporate groups domiciled in Switzerland with annual sales of 750 million euros or more will now be subject to a 15-percent minimum tax rate, should their previously calculated total tax rate fall below the 15-percent threshold - a possibility in low-tax cantons like Zug. Firms active solely in Switzerland, and those with annual incomes lower than 750 million euros a year, will be charged the regular rates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCantonal and local corporate income tax\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs well as federal corporate income tax, each\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/lifestyle/swiss-counties\"\u003ecanton\u003c/a\u003e charges its own income tax, as does the \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/expat-info/government-agencies-switzerland/swiss-councils-gemeinde\"\u003elocal council (\u003cem\u003eGemeinde\u003c/em\u003e)\u003c/a\u003e.

In Switzerland, as of 2025, this amounts to 8,1 percent of the product or service's value. Essential items such as toiletries, \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/expat-info/swiss-healthcare-system/pharmacies-medicine-switzerland\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003emedicines\u003c/a\u003e and food benefit from reduced-rate VAT at 2,6 percent.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVAT is levied on businesses in Switzerland. The prices that they charge to customers for products or services already include VAT. The business must then collect the VAT they receive and pass it on to the government. At the same time, if the business has to buy other products or services in order to produce their own goods or provide their own services, it can deduct any VAT paid on these goods/services from the VAT it owes to the state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Switzerland, businesses with an annual turnover of 100.000 Swiss francs or more must pay VAT. They must register with the Federal Tax Administration for a VAT number and account for their VAT. VAT invoicing is carried out electronically, usually either quarterly or every six months.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eImport duty\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of value-added taxation, all goods arriving in Switzerland from another nation must pay import duty. This applies if the product has been imported for commercial use and is not a possession. In addition to the VAT added to domestic products, the product itself is weighed and evaluated in order to determine the amount of duty you pay. Goods such as alcohol, food items, textiles and tobacco are generally charged a higher rate when entering Switzerland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eProperty taxes in Switzerland\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe majority of Switzerland does not have a specific property tax. Instead, the transfer of property is taxed based on any income made in selling or switching properties. Some communities levy their own property tax, but this is rare. Any profit made on property is charged in the same way as federal corporate income tax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSwiss securities transfer tax\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are transferring foreign or Swiss securities from different accounts, the federal government will charge you a security transfer or turnover tax. Securities in this case refer to stocks, bonds, shares and other financial instruments. The transfer of these securities is charged at 0,15 percent of their total value, or 0,3 percent if it is being transferred by a foreign account. This tax is not applied during mergers, reorganisations or liquidations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eStamp tax\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stamp tax or capital duty tax is a wealth tax for companies levied by the federal government. The tax is charged based on the total assets of the company, including real estate, products and total savings. The first 1 million Swiss francs of value is exempt, and anything above that value is charged at 1 percent of the\u0026nbsp;company\u0026rsquo;s total worth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCapital tax\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe capital tax is the same as the stamp tax but is charged by cantons\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003eand the \u003cem\u003eGemeinde\u003c/em\u003e. The tax is set by the needs of the community and can vary depending on the region where your business is based.

Below we look at some of the most common ones and offer some advice on how to answer them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eInterview questions about you\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eNaturally, you can expect to have to answer some questions about yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eCan you introduce yourself?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis question often comes first. Although the purpose of this question is usually to ease the candidate in, don\u0026rsquo;t miss the opportunity to spin it into a way to talk about what makes you a good fit for the role. This is your classic \u0026ldquo;elevator pitch\u0026rdquo; introduction. The focus should be on what makes you an ideal candidate for the job, perhaps with some information about your interests thrown in. It\u0026rsquo;s key to keep it relatively short, no more than two to three minutes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eCan you tell us about some of your achievements?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis gives you the opportunity to show off a little, without overdoing it. You should focus on some recent and relevant career highlights, and explain how they had an impact on the company you were working for at the time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhat are your strengths?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis common question is asking how well-qualified you are for the position. It\u0026rsquo;s a good idea therefore in your answer to focus on the skills that make you a good fit for the job you\u0026rsquo;re interviewing for. Be sure to give some examples to back up your answer.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhat are your weaknesses?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s good to be honest here - but not brutally so. Keep the job description in mind as well: if you\u0026rsquo;re applying for a role as a PA, don\u0026rsquo;t tell them you\u0026rsquo;re scatty and constantly losing things. Try to put a positive spin on your answer, for instance by talking about a weakness you\u0026rsquo;ve recognised in yourself and taken steps to improve.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhere do you see yourself in five years?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eLots of interviews will feature a question like this that focuses on your long-term trajectory and ambitions. Basically, the interviewer is asking how this job fits in. They want to know if you\u0026rsquo;re going to stick around, or if you\u0026rsquo;ll upstick as soon as you find a better opportunity. Focusing on both your short- and long-term goals, explain how this role and the company fit into your career plan.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eSwiss job interview questions about your work experience\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eYou can be pretty sure that your interview will also include some questions about the advertised role, your current role and any other work experience you have.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhy did you apply for this job?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis specific question requires a super-specific answer. It\u0026rsquo;s no good saying you\u0026rsquo;re a data analyst and this is a data analyst vacancy; the interviewer wants to know how much you really want the job, and what makes you a good fit for it. Explain, giving examples, why you would be suited to the role, and what you would focus on if you were hired. You could also talk about things you know about the company that appeal to you.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhy are you the best candidate for the job?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis question is asking what makes you stand out from the other candidates. Of course, you don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about the other candidates. Instead, you need to prepare a confident and concise summary of what you have to offer, and why it aligns with what the company is looking for. It\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to check the job description once again when preparing an answer to this question.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eHow do you deal with stressful situations?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eNot every day at \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/career/working-in-switzerland\"\u003ework\u003c/a\u003e is always a good one. By asking you this question, the interviewer wants to know how you deal with stressful or conflict situations. Rather than claiming that you never experience stress, you should give an example of how you successfully managed a stressful situation in a previous job.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhat are your salary expectations?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003ePlenty of people clam up when talk turns to salary expectations. However, you should expect it, so do some research before the interview so you are able to present a salary range that\u0026rsquo;s reasonable based on your job title, experience, skills and location. \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/career/working-in-switzerland/salary-payslip-swiss-minimum-wage\"\u003eSalaries in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e vary widely depending on location and profession, so make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t over- or underestimate how much you can expect to be paid.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eJob interview questions about the company\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn most job interviews, there will also be a few questions about the company.

Don\u0026rsquo;t bore them with details they already know (\u0026ldquo;The company was founded in 2008 by Joe Bloggs\u0026rdquo;), but prepare some key talking points about the department you\u0026rsquo;re looking to enter. Did the company recently pass a major milestone? Is there an important launch coming up? You can also discuss how the company\u0026rsquo;s brand, mission or values align with your own personal values or career goals.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhy do you want to work for this company?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis is a kind of hybrid of the question above and the question about wanting this specific job. Again, it pays to be super-specific and give the interviewer what they want: an indication that you\u0026rsquo;re truly enthusiastic about the role and the company. What is it that appeals to you? Show that you have done your research, and choose a topic that genuinely interests you and allows your personality to show.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eInterview questions about your previous job\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eYour interview might also include some questions about your current job role or previous work experience.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhy do you want to leave your current job?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhen answering this question, it\u0026rsquo;s important to strike a balance between being honest and being positive. Even if you are leaving your current job under difficult circumstances, avoid being negative or critical about the company or your manager, and don\u0026rsquo;t share too much information. Rather than listing all the things you don\u0026rsquo;t like about your current job, explain how the new job fits into your career trajectory.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhat will you miss about your current job?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBe positive, but not overly so. Explain what you like about your current role, and then turn your answer towards your new potential employer, picking out aspects of the role that you\u0026rsquo;d enjoy just as much if not more.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWhat questions should you ask at a job interview?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMost interviews will usually end with an opportunity for you, as the candidate, to ask some questions.

Essentially, this is the potential amount the homeowner could make, were they to rent out the property.

Finally, this amount is then capped at somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of the rental value (depending on the canton) to calculate the imputed rental value.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, if you own your home with a mortgage, you can also deduct any interest you pay on your mortgage from your taxable income, as well as some maintenance costs and value-maintaining renovations or conversions.

Canton Schwyz has no property transfer tax or registration fee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDifferent cantons have different rules on who pays the property transfer tax.

This profit is then taxed based on how long you have been resident in the property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOwners that have lived in their homes for long periods of time usually pay significantly less tax when they sell compared to those who resell their homes just a few years after purchasing them. For example, in Canton Zurich, property gains tax is halved if the owner has been in the house for 20 years or more.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBear in mind that if you purchase a new home in Switzerland using the entirety of your profit made on selling your old house, this tax is not charged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHome insurance in Switzerland\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlongside property taxes, all but four Swiss cantons - Geneva, Appenzell Innerrhoden (excluding the district of Oberegg), Ticino and Valais - require homeowners to take out some form of building insurance before purchasing property.

Your mortgage advisor can talk you through all of the details and help you decide which type is best for your personal situation, but here is a brief overview of the most important differences:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFixed-rate mortgages\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThe most common type of mortgage in Switzerland is the fixed-rate mortgage. With this type of mortgage, you \u0026ldquo;fix\u0026rdquo; your interest rate for a predetermined period of time, usually between 10 and 20 years.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis means that your regular payments will remain the same for the duration of your fixed term, regardless of market conditions, allowing for long-term financial planning. If interest rates go up, your monthly repayments will remain the same - however, you equally won\u0026rsquo;t benefit if interest rates fall.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eAt the end of your fixed rate term, you will either switch to a variable rate mortgage or renegotiate a new fixed-rate mortgage.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eVariable-rate mortgages in Switzerland\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eA variable rate mortgage, as the name suggests, follows market conditions. Instead of having a fixed mortgage interest rate, your interest rate will rise and fall in line with official interest rates. This means that your monthly repayments may go up or down during the life of your mortgage. If mortgage interest rates fall, you will feel the benefit of this more quickly than if you had a fixed-rate mortgage, but equally if interest rates rose, so would your repayments.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOne benefit of variable-rate mortgages is that your initial interest rate is usually lower than it would be for a fixed-rate mortgage. However, that is liable to change over the term of your mortgage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eMany policies have no minimum repayment, meaning contracts can last up to 50 years. This may be more manageable as a monthly payment, but it also means that it could take a long time for you to pay off your mortgage.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eInterbank offered rate mortgage (LIBOR and SARON)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eInterbank rates or average-rate overnight mortgages are variable rate mortgages that only change in cost after a specific period of time. Instead of changing each month like a traditional variable rate mortgage, LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) or SARON (Swiss Average Rate Overnight) mortgages see their costs changed every three, six or 12 months.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis means you are less vulnerable to dramatic increases in interest rates and yet still benefit from a more flexible policy. Since 2021, LIBOR rates have started to be phased out in favour of SARON rates, meaning that interest rates will adhere to the Swiss market instead of a global London-based metric. A SARON mortgage is typically short-term, with banks usually offering them for four to 10 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBridging loans in Switzerland\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eBridging loans are designed to cover the cost of buying a new house while your old house is being sold.

Around half the population of Switzerland knows how to ski.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sport relies on consistent snowfall during the winter, and a mixture of gradual, steep or sheer slopes to ski on, typically found in many \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/lifestyle/about-switzerland/swiss-mountains\"\u003eSwiss mountain ranges\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnowboarding is also popular in Switzerland, especially\u0026nbsp;among\u0026nbsp;young people.

Larger ski resorts can use snow cannons to compensate for the lack of snow, but may have a restricted selection of ski runs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost ski resorts open in early November each year, continuing until mid-April the following year.

Black runs typically involve steep gradients of 40 degrees or more. They can be groomed on occasion, but only where the gradient allows.

For high society, new ski clubs were formed that offered ski trips, Nordic skiing and other winter sports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClub culture reached its peak in the early 20th century, with the creation of the most famous alpine\u0026nbsp;club in Switzerland, the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club.

Ski and snowboards became mass-produced, meaning more people could afford to go skiing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, ski tourism represents 1 percent of Switzerland\u0026rsquo;s GDP, but in mountainous areas like Graub\u0026uuml;nden and Valais, it accounts for 10 percent.

Blessed with the snowy winter climate of northern Europe, and the warm summers of southern Europe, the country often seems to have the best of both worlds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is the Swiss climate like?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwitzerland\u0026rsquo;s unique terrain makes it\u0026nbsp;difficult to forecast\u0026nbsp;across the whole country. While the weather is like many other parts of Europe in that it is highly seasonal, it is also very dependent on location and altitude. Switzerland\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/lifestyle/about-switzerland/swiss-mountains\"\u003emountains\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/lifestyle/about-switzerland/swiss-lakes\"\u003elakes\u003c/a\u003e not only divide the country into geographical regions, but they also divide the country into different weather spheres - while one mountain village may see snow,\u0026nbsp;another village on the other side of the mountain\u0026nbsp;may see clear blue skies. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the weather typically looks across Switzerland\u0026rsquo;s regions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eNorthern Switzerland\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weather in Switzerland is largely regionalised, though there are some patterns throughout the country. One part of the country that is important to pay attention to is the Swiss Alps, with \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/lifestyle/swiss-counties\"\u003ecantons\u003c/a\u003e north of the mountain range being warmer than the alpine regions to the south and southeast.

As a general rule, south-facing mountain slopes, which get sunlight for much of the day, will be warmer than those facing any other direction, and wide valleys will see more sunlight than narrow ones.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSouthern Switzerland\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the southernmost part of Switzerland in Canton Ticino, the weather can be particularly warm during the summer months. Many of the valleys in Southern Switzerland can trap the summer sun, remaining dry and warm even into the early autumn while the weather in the rest of the country cools down. Temperatures are far closer to a Mediterranean climate, leading to milder winters and hot summers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAlpine and mountainous regions\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the mountains, the temperature is much cooler than elsewhere in the country due to the high altitude. Some mountainous areas, such as the southeastern part of the Alps, are drier than other mountains in the west of the country. Often, precipitation from the Atlantic falls on the western mountains before the weather front even hits the east, which is what makes it drier.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSwiss weather per season\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwitzerland has a mild climate, but it\u0026rsquo;s certainly not a boring one!

The coldest spring ever recorded in Switzerland was in 1837, when the average temperature reached just 3,8 degrees celsius!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWarmest spring ever\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warmest spring in Switzerland took place in 2007, though temperatures also hit similar highs in 2011 as well. In the south of the country, temperatures soared to over 30 degrees celsius in the daytime and more than 20 degrees celsius at night - an impressive record!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSwiss summer\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite perceptions of Switzerland being dominated by images of thick snow and the ski season, summer can be hot for much of the country.

Of course, in the mountains, the slopes in the shade may still be covered in snow, and summer temperatures may be much cooler because of the altitude. For most of Switzerland, the average temperature during the summer is perfect for hiking and water sports on or around some of the country\u0026rsquo;s stunning lakes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eColdest summer ever\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile summer is the warmest season in Switzerland, some of the high-altitude regions are still very cold. Jungfraujoch, one of the most popular mountain tourist spots, can see average temperatures of -2 degrees celsius every July! 1816, also known as the \"year without summer\", saw the coldest summer ever recorded in Switzerland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWarmest summer ever\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe modern-day benchmark for hot summers in Switzerland is that of 2003, where temperatures in the country soared above average for the whole season. That year, the country recorded its highest temperature ever of 41,5 degrees celsius in the canton of Graub\u0026uuml;nden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAutumn in Switzerland\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutumn can bring unreliable weather conditions in Switzerland, much like spring, but it can also be a truly beautiful season to celebrate in the country.

Much the same as the summer, the coldest autumn seasons take place at the highest altitudes, with some of the highest inhabited peaks seeing temperatures of -10 degrees celsius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWarmest autumn ever\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutumn highs can often be found in the \u0026ldquo;flatter\u0026rdquo; parts of Switzerland, or in the south of the country. Both Sion and Lugano have average temperatures of 17 degrees for October each year - a lovely trip to either one could extend your time in the summer sun!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSwiss winter\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArguably the most popular season for tourists and a wonderful season for \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/lifestyle/about-switzerland/swiss-ski-resorts\"\u003eskiing and snowboard\u003c/a\u003eing, Switzerland\u0026rsquo;s winter season is renowned for its thick snow and general cosy feel!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eAverage winter temperature\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAverage winter temperatures in Switzerland are usually below 5 degrees celsius, and can drop as low as an average of -14,5 degrees in some spots. In the mountains, extreme cold days can happen, with temperatures right down to around -25 degrees, though this is not always common during winter.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eColdest winter ever\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coldest winter temperatures are often measured in places with high altitudes. However, extremely cold winter seasons are becoming rarer due to climate change. January is typically the coldest month in the winter, with temperatures lying around just 1 degree for the whole month. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Switzerland was in 1987 at the weather station at La Br\u0026eacute;vine, when the thermometer dropped to -41,8 degrees celsius.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWarmest winter ever\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinters in Switzerland have been getting warmer for the past 30 years, which has seen the country set new seasonal temperature records in recent times, having had abnormally warm winters in 2007, 2016 and 2020. According to scientists and meteorologists, average winter temperatures in Switzerland will rise a further 3,5 degrees between now and 2050.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow often does it rain in Switzerland?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwitzerland sees approximately 1.500 mm of rain every year, which falls mostly between the months of May and August. Though this may sound like a lot, from a global perspective, Switzerland is actually a pretty dry country. Monsoon nations and tropical countries tend to see much more rain than those in Europe, and even out of European nations, Switzerland\u0026rsquo;s rainfall is somewhere in the middle.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow often does the sun shine in Switzerland?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun also shines a lot in Switzerland, but like much of the country\u0026rsquo;s weather, it is highly regionalised. In the west of the country, there is sunshine between 39 and 62 percent of the time, while in the east, it varies less, with sunshine between 42 and 56 percent of the time. The least sunny part of the country is central and northern Switzerland, with sunshine between 35 and 48 percent of the time - meaning that less than half of all days see sunshine!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWeather in Switzerland: All-time records\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are some interesting Swiss weather records:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eColdest Swiss day\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coldest temperature ever measured in Switzerland took place in January 1987 in La Br\u0026eacute;vine. The area is known for its freezing-cold microclimate which helped it to achieve Switzerland\u0026rsquo;s coldest temperature ever. On January 12, 1987, La Br\u0026eacute;vine recorded a temperature of -41,8 degrees celsius, corrected to -42,5 degrees celsius under modern measurements - truly freezing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eLongest heatwave in Swiss history\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn recent years, Switzerland has had more heatwaves during the summer, with many parts of the country experiencing prolonged periods of hot summer sun. In 2018 and 2019, the country was hotter than usual for over one week at a time. In July 2019, the heatwave lasted around eight days, covering all of Europe.

Since then, the flag has remained one of the only square national flags in the world, making it instantly recognisable as the flag of Switzerland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe design of the Swiss flag\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bold red background of the Swiss national flag corresponds to Pantone 485 C which is a mixture of magenta and yellow. The white cross of Switzerland and the red background both have their origin in the late Middle Ages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe meaning of the Swiss cross\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoldiers fighting in the Battle of Laupen on June 21, 1339, attached a white cross to their armour and weapons to distinguish themselves from their enemies. The Old Swiss Confederation incorporated a similar flag as its uniting standard, with a thinner white cross on a red background. The official flag of the Swiss Confederation held on to the white cross emblem, eventually incorporating a thicker version of it into the flag seen today, in the year 1848.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWhy is the Swiss flag square?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the Battle of Laupen, the Swiss cross became the centre point of the country\u0026rsquo;s national flag. The square nature of the flag comes from the fact that the standard was first hung off a halberd pole, the favoured weapon of Swiss soldiers at the time. Its unusual shape has, however, caused several problems over the years, namely during international events such as sporting competitions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2004, the International Olympic Committee ruled that each country competing in the Olympics must use the same rectangular format so that no one flag stands out - meaning for many international sporting events, the country now uses a rectangular version of its national flag.

Here are some of the most interesting facts about Switzerland\u0026rsquo;s national flag:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Swiss flag is very often confused with the Red Cross\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe humanitarian International Committee of the Red Cross organisation was created by Henri Dunant (a merchant and author from \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/lifestyle/cities-switzerland/geneva-city-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eGeneva\u003c/a\u003e) and Swiss general Henri Dufour in 1864. Dufour proposed the organisation\u0026rsquo;s flag should be the Swiss flag, simply inverted - causing confusion still to this day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe only other country with a square national flag is Vatican City\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwitzerland is not alone in having to ditch its square flag in favour of a rectangular one for the Olympics - Vatican City has a square flag too. Both countries are outliers in international events thanks to their unusual flag shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe first Swiss national flag was the same as modern-day Lithuania\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first version of an official national flag was actually green, red and yellow, used by the Helvetic Republic - the puppet state established by Napoleon in 1798. It resembles the inverted flag of today\u0026rsquo;s national flag of Lithuania and was designed as a tricolour similar to the French flag. The flag was only used for five years before being replaced with the old symbol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eNobody can quite figure out why Switzerland\u0026rsquo;s flag is red\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheories range from the colour's representation of the blood of Christ to the cantonal\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003eemblem of the de-facto Swiss capital, Bern. Either way, the Swiss have long used the colour red as a sort of national theme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe flag\u0026rsquo;s shade of red is popular with others, too\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Switzerland red\u0026rdquo;, which is Pantone 485 C, is also the same shade of red used by McDonald\u0026rsquo;s and Lego for their logos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSwiss cantonal flags\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Swiss national flag is not the country\u0026rsquo;s only square flag.

Initially, the flag used the same bear emblem, on a plain white background, but changed to the design seen today in the 13th century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eVaud\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe design of the Vaud\u0026nbsp;cantonal\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003eflag is relatively modern in comparison with many of the country\u0026rsquo;s other regional flags. Dating back to 1803, the flag\u0026rsquo;s bold green and white design bears the motto \"\u003cem\u003eLibert\u0026eacute; et patrie\u003c/em\u003e\" - Liberty and Homeland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eGeneva\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneva\u0026rsquo;s flag is possibly one of the most extravagant cantonal\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003eflags in the country.

The staff depicted on the flag is a representation of an actual staff that existed centuries ago, assumed to be a relic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eLucerne\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucerne\u0026rsquo;s flag is very similar to that of Zurich, with a simplistic blue and white design, though is divided horizontally, rather than diagonally. Again, the symbolism behind the blue and white of the flag is thought to represent the colours of the surrounding areas in Lucerne.\u003c/p\u003e"])

The area was first settled by Alemannic peoples, who eventually came under Frankish rule. During this time,\u0026nbsp;the settlement quickly expanded, with evidence being found of\u0026nbsp;the town minting its own coins in the 7th century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasel was part of the Frankish Carolingian Empire and ruled directly by a bishop, with the bishopric of Basel being established in the 8th century, supposedly by Charlemagne. The town was part of West Francia when the Carolingian Empire split but was then passed to East Francia. It was then destroyed by Magyar raiders in 917; the city was rebuilt as part of the new\u0026nbsp;Kingdom of Upper Burgundy, eventually being incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBishops, riots and freedom\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKing Rudolf III of Germany donated the Moutier-Grandval Abbey and all its possessions and lands to the bishopric of Basel, starting the rule of Basel\u0026rsquo;s Prince-Bishops. Construction of Basel\u0026rsquo;s M\u0026uuml;nster began in 1019 and from then on the city started to take shape. A market was built, a council oversaw the city and, just like many other Swiss cities, guilds were established. The city continued to pledge allegiance to the bishops, but towards the end of the 14th century the city was practically independent of imperial and bishopric rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1376, a riot broke out in the city. The event came to be known as \u003cem\u003eB\u0026ouml;se Fasnacht\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e(Bad/Evil Carnival) and saw the killing of a number of men serving under Leopold III, the Duke of Austria. The city tried to save face by blaming foreigners for the insurrection and executed the perpetrators. However, the city was given a fine and placed under the control of the House of Habsburg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasel joined the Swabian League of Cities in 1385. The league was a military alliance between several free cities aimed at protecting their rights and privileges. The following year, the Battle of Sempach was fought between the Old Swiss Confederacy - which at that point included the cantons of Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden - and the Duchy of Austria. The battle ended in a decisive victory for the Swiss Confederation and Prince Leopold was killed. A treaty was struck up in 1393, and by 1400 the city was essentially free from both the Habsburgs and the bishops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMember of the Swiss Confederacy\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasel remained neutral during the Swabian War between the Old Swiss Confederacy and the House of Habsburg.

The city was the only \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/lifestyle/swiss-counties\"\u003ecanton\u003c/a\u003e to be asked to join. The city stipulated that it would only join the confederation if it was allowed to remain neutral during future conflicts. In 1503, construction began on a new city hall, after the Bishop of Basel refused to give the city a new constitution. In 1529 the city became Protestant under its new bishop, Oecolampadius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eLater History\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasel remained a unified canton throughout the French invasion in 1798 and the institution of the Helvetic Republic. However, in 1830, political disputes broke out between citizens from the city and citizens from the countryside, which culminated in the people from the countryside beseeching those from the city for equal rights and representation. After the conflict between the two factions, Switzerland\u0026rsquo;s highest authority, the Tagsatzung, separated the city from the countryside: forming the new half cantons of Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landschaft in 1833.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1897 the first World Zionist Congress was held in Basel.

The city subsequently became the first in the world where art was acquired at the behest of a democratic decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat to do in Basel: Sightseeing and activities\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are so many things to do in the city of Basel, but, if you\u0026rsquo;re struggling for ideas, check out our list below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eTake in the city\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasel is one of the most beautiful cities in Switzerland, and you would be doing yourself a disservice if you did not see its most famous and impressive \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/lifestyle/sights-attractions\"\u003esights\u003c/a\u003e. Probably the best place to start is Basel\u0026rsquo;s charming old town. From here you are just a short walk from a whole host of cultural heritage sites.

Not only is it the capital of the canton, but it is also the de facto capital of Switzerland. The people in Bern predominantly speak Bernese German, an Alemannic Swiss German dialect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBern\u0026rsquo;s city centre boasts stunning medieval architecture and has been recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With its charmingly historical look and feel, there are plenty of things to do in Bern. From museums and festivals to sports events, there really is something for everyone in this magical city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eA short history of Bern\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe area that now makes up the city of Bern was first settled in the third century BC by tribal people known as the Helvetii. The Romans would eventually settle the area themselves, founding a small village (a \u003cem\u003evicus\u003c/em\u003e) on the Engehalbinsel, at the site of the original Helvetic settlement. Farms started sprouting up around the \u003cem\u003evicus \u003c/em\u003eand, even after the fall of the Roman Empire, settlements remained in the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eFoundation of the city\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe city of Bern as we know it today begins with Berthold V, Duke of Z\u0026auml;hringen, who founded the city in 1191. After Berthold died without an heir, Bern gained town privileges and was made into an Imperial Free City after Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II issued the Golden Charter of Bern (\u003cem\u003eGoldene Handfeste\u003c/em\u003e) in 1218.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLegend says that Bern got its name from Berthold V's vow to name the city after the first animal he hunted, which turned out to be a bear. The animal was adopted to the city\u0026rsquo;s coat of arms from the 1200s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the Golden Charter of Bern is widely considered to be a forgery, done on behalf of Bern\u0026rsquo;s government to establish the city\u0026rsquo;s rights in writing, King Rudolph I of Germany confirmed all the rights set out in the Charter in 1274. The city was initially governed by a mayor, who came from one of the noble families that were \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/expat-info/official-issues/swiss-citizenship-schweizer-buergerrecht\"\u003ecitizens\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;of Bern. By the late 13th century, Bern was a de facto independent city-state within the Holy Roman Empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAdmission to the Old Swiss Confederacy\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1323, Bern entered into an alliance with the cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden. Bern adopted an expansionist policy, which brought it into conflict with feudal lords and the neighbouring city of Fribourg. Bern\u0026rsquo;s army defeated the forces of Canton Fribourg, which eventually led to closer relationships with Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1353, Bern became a permanent member of the Old Swiss Confederacy. Bern would take a leading role in the new union\u0026nbsp;and encouraged a more expansionist policy into the previously French and Savoyard territory to the north and west.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1405, Bern was devasted by a massive fire, which led to many of its buildings being replaced with half-timbered houses and sandstone buildings. In 1415, Bern invaded Aarau and then \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/lifestyle/swiss-counties/canton-vaud-guide\"\u003eVaud\u003c/a\u003e, defeating both by 1555. It also added the Bernese Oberland to its territories, becoming the largest canton in the confederacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eLater history\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a brief battle at Grauholz and Neuenegg, Bern was occupied by French troops during the French Revolutionary Wars and was stripped of its French-speaking territories. Following the Act of Mediation, which was issued by Napoleon Bonaparte himself, the Helvetic Republic was abolished in 1803, and Bern regained some of its lost territories, once again becoming the largest canton in the confederacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eIs Bern the capital of Switzerland?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBern also acquired new territories after the Congress of Vienna in 1814, namely the Bernese Jura. In 1848, Bern was proclaimed as Switzerland\u0026rsquo;s federal city (the seat of the Federal Assembly).

However, once the main local lord's family line died out, the House of Savoy from Italy inherited their lands and began a power struggle with the bishop for control of the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1447, the House of Savoy elevated a member of its own family, Antipope Felix V, to the position of bishop of Geneva. The noblemen of Geneva managed to reach an agreement with its new ruler for the establishment of the Grand Council, a democratically elected body that represented the citizens of the city and elected the bishop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriction continued to grow between the Dukes of Savoy and the Grand Council, especially after Duke Charles III of Savoy appointed his cousin as bishop. The Grand Council attempted to fight the appointment, but the city was invaded twice by Savoyard forces to push the decision through. The first invasion ended in severe punishments for the Grand Council. The second invasion led to pro-independence factions gaining support and establishing a majority in the Grand Council.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe council voted for independence from Savoyard rule and made an alliance with \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/lifestyle/swiss-counties/canton-bern-guide\"\u003eCanton Bern\u003c/a\u003e and Fribourg, making Geneva allies of the Old Swiss Confederacy, which swore to protect Geneva and its territories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Protestant Reformation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of its alliance with\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/lifestyle/cities-switzerland/bern-city-guide\"\u003eBern\u003c/a\u003e, the city declared itself Protestant. While this justified dissolving the position of bishop, it also alienated the Catholic cantons and even some of the city\u0026rsquo;s citizens. Many of the city\u0026rsquo;s citizens did not relate to the German-speaking canton of Bern, as well as the teachings of Martin Luther and Ulrich\u0026nbsp;Zwingli.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis matter was solved by John Calvin, a French theologian who became spiritual leader of the city, at the behest of the Grand Council. Calvin was popular and successful in getting the city to accept Protestantism while overseeing the city's growth. At this time Geneva developed significantly, with new industries, trades and \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/education/studying-switzerland/swiss-higher-education\"\u003ehigher education\u003c/a\u003e starting to emerge around the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe city strengthened its alliance with the Protestant cantons of Bern and \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/lifestyle/swiss-counties/canton-zurich-guide\"\u003eZurich\u003c/a\u003e; however, it was repeatedly blocked from joining the Old Swiss Confederacy by the Catholic cantons. The House of Savoy tried once more to take the city in 1602, but they were defeated, and the Genevan victory is still celebrated to this day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eClass struggles and annexation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe city became increasingly aristocratic towards the end of the 17th century, as noble French Protestant families or\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eHuguenots\u003c/em\u003e sought refuge in Geneva. Over the course of the 18th century, class struggles developed as a result.

However, Geneva prospered during this time, attracting and producing world-renowned academics like Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneva was annexed by France in 1798, but, due to Napoleon\u0026rsquo;s distrust of the city, its world standing gradually declined. \u0026ldquo;The city where they know English too well\u0026rdquo;, according to Napoleon, began to fall into recession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eReturn to power\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the Congress of Vienna, in 1815, after the fall of Napoleon, Geneva\u0026rsquo;s territories were expanded to 15 Savoyard and six French communes. It was also finally admitted to the Swiss Confederation as a full member. The aristocracy took back control of the city for a time, but subsequently declined and were replaced. During this time, Geneva began to grow into a modern city. In 1907, the city called for the separation of church and state in a newly drafted constitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the World Wars, Geneva became the seat of many \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/career/working-in-switzerland/information-international-companies\"\u003einternational companies\u003c/a\u003e and organisations, including the League of Nations, its successor the\u0026nbsp;United Nations, and the International Labour Organisation, leading to further development of the city through tourism and business. The city also became known as a neutral place to conclude treaties and other diplomatic business, with the Geneva Convention\u0026nbsp;being signed there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe city also made history in 1960 when it became one of the first Swiss cantons to grant women the right to vote in both \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/expat-info/government-agencies-switzerland/swiss-elections-referendums\"\u003ecantonal and communal elections\u003c/a\u003e.

The city is steeped in history, even taking its name from the Abbey of St. Gall, around which the city first grew.

Gallus eventually set up a hermitage in the forests near\u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/lifestyle/about-switzerland/swiss-lakes\"\u003e Lake Constance\u003c/a\u003e, near the source of the Steinach River.

It was also a pilgrimage destination at this time and had guest houses, stables, a \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/expat-info/swiss-healthcare-system/hospitals-switzerland\"\u003ehospital \u003c/a\u003eand even a \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/education/primary-secondary-education\"\u003eschool\u003c/a\u003e. By the 10th century, a small town had grown up around the abbey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first half of the 10th century, the abbey and town were threatened and attacked by Magyar raiders. The abbey caught fire in 937. It was around this time that a wall, with gates and towers, was built around the town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe town then called St. Gall pushed for independence from the abbey in the 12th century. However, the abbey grew in power after its abbot, Ulrich von Sax, was given the title of Imperial Prince by the German King, Philip of Swabia, in 1207. The abbey became its own principality, with corresponding territories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe city eventually freed itself from the rule of the abbey and, in 1291, Abbot Wilhelm von Montfort granted the citizens of the town special privileges. The city eventually came under the control of the old Swiss guilds, who then bought the city\u0026rsquo;s freedom from King Sigismund of Luxembourg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eConflict between the abbey and town\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1405, the town of Saint Gallen became allies with the Old Swiss Confederation.

R\u0026ouml;sch devised a plan with the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope to move the abbey to Rorschach on Lake Constance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, St. Gallen\u0026rsquo;s mayor, Ulrich Varnb\u0026uuml;ler, protested against this, as did the town\u0026rsquo;s citizens. The abbot's plan to move the abbey was supported by four Confederate cantons: Zurich, Lucerne, Schwyz and Glarus. Varnb\u0026uuml;ler did what he could to resist the building of the new abbey, including sending armed troops to destroy the buildings already under construction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eInvasion and reformation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn retaliation, the four cantons moved to invade the town of St. Gallen in 1490. The town was invaded without serious resistance and a treaty was struck, although the terms of the treaty restricted the city\u0026rsquo;s power and obligated the city to pay reparations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1526, the Protestant Reformation made its way to St. Gallen and the town converted to Protestantism. The abbey remained Catholic and stayed true to its religion until 1803, when the Helvetic Republic was overthrown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHelvetic Republic and later history\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Napoleon invaded Switzerland and instituted the Helvetic Republic in 1798, both the abbey and city were combined with Appenzell into one canton called S\u0026auml;ntis. When the Helvetic Republic was dissolved in 1803, St. Gallen was raised to the capital of the Canton of St. Gallen. The new canton suppressed the Abbey of St. Gall and its monks were driven into exile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe city has been involved in the textile industry since at least the 15th century. However, World War I and the Great Depression caused a serious strain on the industry and it only recovered in the 1950s. A small textile industry still survives in St. Gallen today, with its embroidered fabrics still popular with haute couture designers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat to do in St.\u0026nbsp;Gallen: Sightseeing\u0026nbsp;and activities\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you\u0026rsquo;re in St.\u0026nbsp;Gallen, make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t miss out on these!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCheck out the famous Abbey of St. Gall\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone visiting the city should make absolutely sure they explore parts of the abbey from which the city takes its name.

In 15 BC, the Romans built a small fort on the Lindenhof, which, somewhat ironically considering Switzerland\u0026rsquo;s modern stereotype as an international tax haven, was gradually expanded into a tax collection point named Turicum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the Romans, the Swiss plateau was settled by the Germanic Alemanni tribe in the 5th century, and the area became part of various kingdoms and territories, including the kingdom of East Francia and the Holy Roman Empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 853 AD, Louis the German, a grandson of Charlemagne and King of East Francia, founded the Fraum\u0026uuml;nster abbey, a Benedictine convent, to which he bestowed the lands of Zurich, Uri and the Albis hills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMiddle Ages: The flourishing of Zurich\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1045, King Henry III gave the convent special powers, which allowed it to collect taxes, mint coins and hold markets. The city of Zurich gained \u0026ldquo;Imperial immediacy\u0026rdquo; in 1218, essentially relinquishing its ties with local lords and becoming an autonomous Imperial Free City.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe abbess of the Fraum\u0026uuml;nster convent was raised to a duchess in 1234 by Emperor Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire. From then on, the abbess would nominate a mayor of the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the 14th\u0026nbsp;century, political power in the city began to shift to a guild system established by Rudolf Brun in 1336. There were 14 guilds, or \u003cem\u003eZ\u0026uuml;nfte\u003c/em\u003e, in Zurich under this new system, each with their own trade, ranging from butchers to tailors to carpenters, while one was for members of Zurich\u0026rsquo;s nobility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guilds are now central to Zurich society, particularly during the annual \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/expat-info/swiss-national-canton-holidays\"\u003eholiday\u003c/a\u003e of \u003cem\u003eSechsel\u0026auml;uten\u003c/em\u003e.

Zurich was temporarily excluded from the confederacy due to the Old Zurich War in 1440, in which Zurich fought against seven other cantons over the lands of Toggenburg. Zurich was eventually readmitted into the confederacy in 1450.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Swiss Reformation began at the behest of Ulrich Zwingli in the 1520s, which saw several cantons, including Zurich, convert to Protestantism, which resulted in major societal, religious and political changes. Several cantons remained largely Catholic, and escalated tensions led to conflicts that would come to be known as the Wars of Kappel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the next hundred years, Zurich began to take an isolationist attitude and, when the Thirty Years' War ravaged across Europe from 1618 to 1648, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/lifestyle/swiss-counties\"\u003ecantons of Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e stayed out of the conflict, instead providing substantial mercenaries for both sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZurich flourished during the Thirty Years' War, as the conflict provided plenty of opportunities for the Swiss cantons. In 1648, Zurich proclaimed itself a republic and the city was run by powerful families in an oligarchic system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Helvetic Republic\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe French invaded Switzerland in 1798, and the confederacy was dismantled, which marked the end of the\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eAncien R\u0026eacute;gime\u003c/em\u003e in Switzerland. The Helvetic Republic was instituted in its place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe French attempted to reform the political system in Switzerland, but\u0026nbsp;this was fiercely rejected by \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/expat-info/official-issues/swiss-citizenship-schweizer-buergerrecht\"\u003eSwiss citizens\u003c/a\u003e, who rebelled against the French invaders. The rebellion was firmly crushed by the French.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Swiss continued to act against their occupiers, helped support the Austrian and Russian Imperial Armies and rejected calls to support the French army in the conflict. The Helvetic Republic collapsed in 1803, following several uprisings and an accumulation of around 12 million francs in debt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNapoleon Bonaparte himself declared that Switzerland was a federal system, and it would be unwise to force any other kind of political system upon the country. The Act of Mediation was passed by Bonaparte in 1803, abolishing the Helvetic Republic and restabilising the cantons and the Swiss Confederacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eModern history\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1848, Zurich led the Swiss Confederation against the Sonderbund cantons, a collection of predominantly Catholic cantons, which fought against the centralisation of power. This led to a civil war, called the Sonderbund War, which eventually concluded with a new federal constitution that transformed Switzerland into a federal republic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuge developments in the city during the 19th century led to mass migration and Zurich flourished again during this period. Switzerland\u0026rsquo;s first railway was built in 1847 between Zurich and Baden, soon extending to \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/lifestyle/cities-switzerland/aarau-city-guide\"\u003eAarau\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026nbsp;This\u0026nbsp;was followed by the construction of\u0026nbsp;Zurich Hauptbahnhof. Zurich\u0026rsquo;s famous Bahnhofstrasse was also built during this time and, in 1877, the Zurich Stock Exchange was founded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite being accidentally bombed during the Second World War, the industrialisation and mass migration that began in the 19th century propelled Zurich into the city we know today: a cultural, financial, and educational capital of Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThings to do in Zurich: Sightseeing\u0026nbsp;and activities\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether you fancy taking a walk through the historical city centre, shopping, admiring stunning vistas or partying with friends, there is something for everyone in Zurich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eDiscover Zurich\u0026rsquo;s past\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of history and \u003ca href=\"https://www.iamexpat.ch/lifestyle/sights-attractions\"\u003esightseeing\u003c/a\u003e, then Zurich is the perfect place for you.
